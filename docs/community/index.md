Contributing to Cello is straightforward. Follow these steps to go from zero to merged PR.

=== "Step 1 -- Fork & Clone"

    ```bash
    # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cello.git
    cd cello

    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install development dependencies
    pip install maturin pytest requests
    ```

=== "Step 2 -- Build & Test"

    ```bash
    # Build Rust extensions in development mode
    maturin develop

    # Run the test suite
    pytest tests/ -v

    # Run Rust checks
    cargo clippy --all-targets
    cargo fmt --check
    cargo test
    ```

=== "Step 3 -- Branch & Code"

    ```bash
    # Create a feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

    # Make your changes, then verify
    cargo clippy --all-targets
    pytest tests/ -v
    ```

=== "Step 4 -- Submit PR"

    ```bash
    # Commit with a clear message
    git add -A
    git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature"
