## FAQ

### What Python versions does Cello support?

Python 3.12 and later. Cello uses the PyO3 abi3 stable ABI, so a single binary works across Python 3.12+.

### How do I install Cello?

```bash
pip install cello-framework
```

For development, build from source with Maturin:

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

### How do I report a bug?

Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jagadeesh32/cello/issues) with:

- Cello version
- Python version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior

### Can I use Cello in production?

Cello is in active development. Check the current version and release notes before deploying to production. Evaluate the framework against your specific requirements.

### What makes Cello fast?

Cello's Rust core handles HTTP parsing, routing, and JSON serialization, which are the most performance-critical parts of a web server. Python is used only for business logic. Moving the hot path into native Rust is what delivers Cello's throughput.

### Where can I find examples?

The `examples/` directory in the repository contains 20+ example applications covering all major features. Start with `examples/hello.py` for the basics.
