# :material-broadcast: Streaming & Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) let a server push a sequence of messages to a client over a single long-lived HTTP connection — no WebSocket handshake required. Cello provides `SseStream` and `SseEvent` to build these streams declaratively: you add named events to a stream object and return it from a route handler, and Cello handles the `text/event-stream` content type, chunked transfer encoding, and correct newline framing automatically.

## Features Demonstrated

- `SseStream` — collects an ordered sequence of SSE frames to be flushed as a streaming response
- `SseEvent` — named event objects carrying arbitrary string data
- `stream.add_data(text)` — appends a bare `data:` frame (no event name)
- `stream.add_event(name, json_string)` — appends a named event with a JSON payload
- Multiple independent SSE endpoints on the same app (`/sse/events`, `/sse/counter`, `/sse/stock-ticker`)
- Large non-streaming JSON response (`/large-response`) for comparison benchmarking
- `app.enable_cors()` and `app.enable_logging()` working alongside streaming routes

## Running This Example

```bash
python examples/streaming_demo.py
# Test:
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Key Concepts

- **`curl -N`** — the `-N` flag disables curl's internal buffering so SSE frames are printed to the terminal as they arrive, rather than being held until the connection closes.
- **`add_data` vs `add_event`** — `add_data` emits an anonymous `data:` frame that browsers receive as a `message` event; `add_event` emits a named `event:` line followed by `data:`, which lets client-side `EventSource` listeners filter by event type.
- **Returning `SseStream` from a handler** — Cello detects the `SseStream` return type and automatically sets `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, disables response buffering, and streams each frame as it is added, so the pattern is identical to returning a plain dict for JSON responses.
- **`json.dumps(stock)` in the stock ticker** — SSE data payloads are plain strings; serialising dicts with `json.dumps` before passing them to `add_event` keeps the handler explicit about what is sent over the wire and avoids hidden serialisation surprises.
- **SSE vs WebSockets** — SSE is unidirectional (server → client) and works over plain HTTP/1.1 with automatic reconnection built into the browser `EventSource` API, making it a lighter-weight choice than WebSockets for push notifications, live feeds, and progress reporting.
