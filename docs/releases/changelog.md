## v1.0.1 -- Cross-Platform & Compatibility Patch

**Cross-Platform Fixes:**
- Windows multi-worker: subprocess re-execution (`CELLO_WORKER=1`) instead of broken `multiprocessing.Process`
- Windows signal handling: `SIGTERM` wrapped in `try/except`, platform validation for signals
- Windows static files: UNC path normalization fix
- Linux-only CPU affinity: gated with warning on other platforms
- ARM JSON: `serde_json` fallback for non-SIMD architectures

**Compatibility Fixes:**
- Async handler validation: `wrap_handler_with_validation` now supports async handlers
- Async guard wrappers: `_apply_guards` creates async/sync wrappers based on handler type
- Async cache decorator: `cache()` now supports async handlers
- Blueprint validation & guards: Blueprint route decorators now support `guards` parameter and validation
- Guards exported in `__all__`: `RoleGuard`, `PermissionGuard`, `Authenticated`, `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `GuardError`, `ForbiddenError`, `UnauthorizedError`
- Database exports: `Database`, `Redis`, `Transaction` added to `__all__`

## v1.0.0 -- Production Ready

- First stable release with semantic versioning guarantees
- Major performance optimizations: handler metadata caching, lazy body parsing, zero-copy responses
- TCP_NODELAY, HTTP keep-alive, and pipeline flush for lower latency
- VecDeque ring buffer for O(1) latency tracking (was O(n))
- Atomic fast-path checks for DI, guards, middleware, and lifecycle hooks
- Optimized release build: LTO fat, panic=abort, strip, overflow-checks=false
- API stability commitment: no breaking changes until v2.0
- All 394 tests passing
